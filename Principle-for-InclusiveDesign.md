# Empathy is an integral part of the inclusive design system, it serves the designer a great deal to think of the limitations and motivation that drives all types of humans.
Designing for inclusion brings into light the opportunities product designers have to serve people across the board, designing for the differently able is essentially designing for everyone.
#Why does it matter?
When product are created , they are ideally meant to be desinged for all people, rather than just a section of them.

# Three Principle of Inclusive Design
1. Recognizing exclusion:
- When designers solve problems using their own basic, exclusion arises.
- In today's context, the term "differently-abled" is not just limited to phyical disabilities or health conditions; it include everything from situartional impairments to activity limitations on participation.

2. Learn from diversity
 The main goal of an inclusive design system is taking account of diversity.

3. Solve for one, extend to many
